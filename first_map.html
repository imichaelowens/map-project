	<p>I originally moved to Sarasota, Florida in 2004 when I was 8 years old. I have moved a lot due to my parents looking for the "perfect" house. It has been a life learning experience for me to live in different parts of Sarasota and I made a lot of friends a long the journey. Now I live in Gainesville, Florida but my work requires me to travel a lot so I still get to see amazing new places. Click the blue map pin icons to learn about each place I lived. </p>
